# What is the purpose of the NvPak project? ‚ú®

Maybe you have tried to configure Neovim multiple times over the past few years. Neovim has undergone many changes, and every time, you had to follow new defaults to reach the minimum configuration and start writing your configuration for Neovim. The goal of the nvpak project is to provide these defaults.

Now you can configure only what you need by forking nvpak without any add-ons. Please note that nvpak is not a Neovim configuration and not in competition with other configurations such as NvChad or LazyVim. If you need a complete Neovim setup without any configuration, then this GitHub repository is not for you.

# Why is the name of the project NvPak? üåü

"nv" stands for Neovim and "Pak" is derived from the Persian word "Ÿæÿß⁄©" meaning "clean," which represents brightness and simplicity, contrary to complexity and disorder.

# Installation üíª
## Unix üêß
bash
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Pakrohk-DotFiles/NvPak.git ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```
## Windows ü™ü
powershell
```powershell
bucket add extras
scoop install lazygit
(git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Pakrohk-DotFiles/NvPak.git ~\AppData\Local\nvim\) -and (nvim)
```
### Notes:

You need to have git installed first.
On Unix,nvim command-line executable should be installed. \
If it is not installed, you can install it using your system's **package manager**.\
On Windows, you need to have scoop installed first. \
Then, install lazygit by running scoop install lazygit.\
Afterwards, run the remaining commands sequentially.

The --depth 1 option of the git clone command fetches only the latest changes from the repository and does not retrieve the entire history.\
This reduces the download time.\
The \ character in Windows is used to continue a command on a new line.


# Usage: üöÄ

If the software plugins are not installed automatically after the first run, follow these steps:

Run the following command inside nvim:

```
:Lazy sync
```

Restart nvim.

Enjoy!
